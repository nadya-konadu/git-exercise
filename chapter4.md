# Chapter 4
The tortoise explained, “Help those who need it, and you will earn your entry. ”

Determined to prove their worth, Billy and Sarah set off into the orchard. They soon spotted a group of small fruits crying because their apple friend had fallen and couldn’t get back up onto its branch. 

“We can help! ” Billy declared. With Sarah's assistance, they gently lifted the apple back to its branch, and the little fruits cheered with joy. 

Further along, they found a sad grape who had lost its way home. “Don’t worry,” said Sarah. “We’ll help you find your way! ” They guided the grape back to its vine, and the grape thanked them with a smile. 

As the sun began to set, Billy and Sarah returned to Tommy, carrying the happy faces of the fruits they had helped. “We did kind deeds! ” Billy said proudly, holding up the grateful fruits. 

Tommy smiled. “You have shown true kindness. You may now enter the Golden Orchard. ”

The gate opened, revealing the most amazing sight. The trees were heavy with sparkling golden fruits that glimmered in the light. Billy and Sarah gasped in awe. 

“You did it! ” Sarah squealed, hugging Billy. “We found it together! ”

As they celebrated their incredible journey, Billy realized that while adventures are exciting, the friends we make and the kindness we show are what truly make each adventure special.
