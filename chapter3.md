# Chapter 3
Excited, they hurried down the path, but suddenly they encountered a large, hairy spider lounging across it. “Who goes there? ” the spider asked, raising its many legs. “To pass, you must answer my riddle! ”

Billy gulped but nodded bravely. “What’s the riddle? ”

The spider spun a delicate web, thinking hard before speaking. “I can fly without wings, I can cry without eyes. Whenever I go, darkness flies. What am I? ”

Billy thought about it, scratching his yellow peel. Sarah began to panic. “Oh no! We’ll never get past him! ”

But Billy remained calm. After a moment of thinking, he exclaimed, “It’s a cloud! ”

The spider blinked in surprise. “Correct! You may pass. ” With that, the spider moved aside, and Billy and Sarah hurried down the path. 

They emerged from the forest into a beautiful valley filled with colorful flowers and bright fruit trees. In the distance, they saw a shimmering light that seemed to sparkle like gold. “That must be the Golden Orchard! ” Sarah shouted, her eyes wide with wonder. 

Eagerly, they rushed toward the light, but when they reached the orchard, they found that it was surrounded by a tall, glimmering fence. At the gate stood a wise old tortoise named Tommy. 

“To enter the Golden Orchard, you must complete a task,” Tommy said slowly. “You must show kindness to others and bring back proof of your good deeds. ”
