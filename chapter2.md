# Joe Meets Sarah
With a bounce in his step, Joe set off down the winding road that led out of Fruityville. As he walked, he hummed a happy tune. The sun shone brightly, and the birds sang sweetly in the trees. He felt excited and free. 

After walking for a while, Joe came across a thick forest. The trees were tall, and their leaves whispered secrets in the wind. Joe hesitated for a moment. Was it safe to go inside? Gathering his courage, he stepped beneath the leafy canopy. 

Inside the forest, everything was calm and peaceful. But as he ventured deeper, he heard a soft whimpering sound. Curious, Joe followed the noise until he found a small, scared strawberry named Sarah stuck in a bush. 

“Help! I can’t get out! ” cried Sarah, her red face streaked with tears. 

Joe dashed to her side. “Don’t worry, Sarah! I’ll help you! ” He carefully pushed the branches away, freeing her from the bush. 

“Oh, thank you, Joe! ” Sarah said, her eyes sparkling with gratitude. “I was so scared. I got lost looking for the Golden Orchard too! ”

“Why don’t you join me on my adventure? ” Joe suggested. “We can find it together! ”

Sarah agreed, and the two new friends journeyed on. As they walked, they talked and shared stories about their dreams.
